⚡This repository is intended **only for viewing portfolio resources** in a **simple and organized format**.

## ⚠️ Note About This Repository

🚧 **This repository contains a non-functional version of my portfolio.**  
We are currently working on fixing some issues, and this version may not run as expected.
🔍 This repo is meant to help **explore the structure and resources** used in my personal portfolio project.

✅ If you're looking for the **working version of my website**, you can find it on my GitHub under the repository name:  
👉 [`my-portfolio`]((https://github.com/manu-Char/MyPortfolio))

⚠️ Please note:  
- The **live code in `my-portfolio`** is functional but **not well-structured** for reading.  
- JavaScript files are **split into chunks**, which might make it harder to understand the code flow directly.  
- Apologies for any inconvenience caused!
